    "1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the data contains input-output pairs (labels). The model learns by comparing its predictions to the correct answers and adjusting itself to reduce errors. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to known outputs.\n",
    "Key Idea: Data + Correct Answers → Learn the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning is used when the data has no labels or correct answers. The model tries to discover hidden patterns, structures, or clusters within the data on its own.\n",
    "Key Idea: Data only → Discover hidden structure.\n",

    "3. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is where an agent learns by interacting with an environment. It receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and gradually learns the best strategy to maximize rewards over time.\n",
    "Key Idea: Trial and Error + Rewards → Learn best actions.\n",
