    "Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of giving them exact step-by-step instructions. In traditional programming, we provide the computer with rules and data, and it produces results. But in Machine Learning, we provide the computer with data and the correct answers, and it automatically discovers the rules or patterns that connect them. Instead of being explicitly programmed for every situation, the system improves its predictions or decisions by learning from examples."
